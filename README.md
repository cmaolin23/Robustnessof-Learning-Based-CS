# Effective and Efficient Attacks Against Learning-Based Community Search Methods

A PyTorch + torch-geometric implementation of our attack methods on learning based community search algorithm.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
python 3.8
networkx
numpy
scipy
scikit-learn
torch 1.7.1
torch-geometric 1.7
```

### Quick Start
Training model on DBLP with surrogate model csgnn and running DBLP with attacked model COCLE
```
python main.py    \
       --data_set DBLP     \
       --gnn_type GAT     \
       --vmodel caf     \
       --smodel csgnn     \
       --num_pos 5     \
       --num_neg 5     \
       --...     \
```
